Hi! sorry about the late submission.

I've completed steps 1-5 of the assignment.

I found it best to commit my changes after each step, as it isn't too much to look at.

I pushed seven times, once to create the repository, then once per step, and finally this .txt file.

Not many troubles with using Github to push and commit changes, but had to spend a little bit to understand the system through Github integration.

No external AI was used, only the in VStudio assistant, which only sped up the process. I checked every line that was autocompleted to make sure there were no errors.
